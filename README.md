# SoCal Coast-Interior Pressure Gradient Tracker 🍃


A Next.js web application that tracks and displays Mean Sea Level Pressure (MSLP) differences between coastal and interior Southern California locations. This tool helps visualize pressure gradients that indicate offshore vs. onshore wind patterns.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
\`\`\`
git clone https://github.com/djtrustgod/SoCal-Coast-Interior-Pressure-Gradient-Tracker.git
cd SoCal-Coast-Interior-Pressure-Gradient-Tracker
\`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`
npm install
\`\`\`

3. Run the development server:
\`\`\`
npm run dev
\`\`\`

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage

### Dashboard

The main dashboard displays:
- Current MSLP for the home location (customizable)
- Pressure gradients for up to 3 comparison locations (customizable)
- **24-hour pressure trend graphs** for each comparison location showing hourly data
- Color-coded interpretations (offshore flow, onshore flow, neutral)
- Last update timestamps in your local timezone (e.g., "Dec 6, 2025, 8:00 PM PST")
- Manual refresh button to fetch the latest data on-demand
- Automatic browser refresh every 5 minutes to keep data current
- Configurable API data caching (1-60 minutes)

### Interpreting Gradients

- **Positive values (red/orange)**: Higher pressure inland → Offshore flow (Santa Ana wind potential)
- **Negative values (blue/cyan)**: Higher pressure at coast → Onshore flow (typical marine layer conditions)
- **Near zero (gray)**: Neutral conditions, minimal pressure gradient

### Location Management

Navigate to the Settings (gear icon) to:
- View all configured locations (coastal vs. interior)
- **Set Home Location**: Click the home icon next to any location to set it as your home base
- **Select Dashboard Locations**: Click the eye icon to add/remove locations from dashboard display (max 3)
- **Configure API Refresh Interval**: Set how often data is fetched from Open-Meteo API (1, 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes)
- Add new locations (up to 25 total)
- Edit existing locations (name, code, coordinates, type, elevation)
- Delete locations (locations in use as home cannot be deleted)
- See location details with visual badges (HOME, DASHBOARD)
- Location counter shows current usage (e.g., "24 of 25 locations configured")

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/pressure
Fetch MSLP data for specified locations.

**Query Parameters:**
- `ids`: Comma-separated location IDs

**Example:**
\`\`\`
GET /api/pressure?ids=sna,sba,dag
\`\`\`

### GET /api/locations
Get all configured locations, home location ID, and dashboard location IDs.

**Response:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "homeLocationId": "sna",
  "dashboardLocationIds": ["sba", "smx", "dag"],
  "locations": [...]
}
\`\`\`

### POST /api/locations
Add a new location.

**Body:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "id": "location-id",
  "name": "Location Name",
  "code": "CODE",
  "latitude": 34.0,
  "longitude": -118.0,
  "type": "coast" | "interior",
  "elevation": 100
}
\`\`\`

### PATCH /api/locations
Update home location, dashboard location selections, or API refresh interval.

**Body (Set Home):**

## Configuration

### Changing the Home Location

**Via UI (Recommended):**
1. Navigate to Settings (gear icon)
2. Find the location you want to set as home
3. Click the home icon next to that location
4. Confirm in the dialog

**Manual Edit:**
Edit `data/locations.json`:
\`\`\`json
{
  "homeLocationId": "sna",  // Change to any location ID
  "dashboardLocationIds": ["sba", "smx", "dag"],  // Up to 3 location IDs
  "locations": [...]
}
\`\`\`

### Adding Custom Locations

Either use the UI or manually edit `data/locations.json`:
\`\`\`json
{
  "id": "custom-id",
  "name": "Custom Location",
  "code": "CUS",
  "latitude": 34.0,
  "longitude": -118.0,
  "type": "coast",
  "elevation": 50
}
\`\`\`

## Data Caching

- **Pressure data**: Revalidated every 1 hour
- **Location config**: Read from file system (instant updates)

## Building for Production

### Standard Build

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
npm run start
\`\`\`

The Next.js app runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Docker Deployment

The application can be deployed using Docker for easy containerized deployment.

#### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed
- Docker Compose (recommended)

#### Quick Start with Docker Compose

\`\`\`bash
# Build and start the container
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the container
docker-compose down
\`\`\`

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Using Docker Directly

\`\`\`bash
# Build the image
docker build -t socal-pressure-tracker .

# Run the container with data persistence
docker run -d \\
  --name socal-pressure-tracker \\
  -p 3000:3000 \\
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \\
  socal-pressure-tracker

# View logs
docker logs -f socal-pressure-tracker

# Stop and remove
docker stop socal-pressure-tracker
docker rm socal-pressure-tracker
\`\`\`

#### Important Notes

⚠️ **Data Persistence**: The `-v ./data:/app/data` volume mount is **critical** for persisting location configuration changes. Without it, any changes made through the UI will be lost when the container restarts.

**Port Configuration**: To use a different port, change the mapping: `-p 8080:3000` maps host port 8080 to container port 3000.

**Network Requirements**: The container needs outbound internet access to reach the Open-Meteo API.
